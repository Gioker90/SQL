# Data Exploration
### Task: exploring the data from a previously created db [Company DB](https://github.com/Gioker90/SQL/blob/09327297583407521845952ada44ebb3c18d44cc/DB%20%26%20table%20creation.md) and performing some analysis on it

- Looking for null or duplicate values

1.Using `COUNT` & `IS NULL` to look for null values in the ID column

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as 'Count of IDs'
FROM HC
WHERE id IS NULL
```
This will be the result: no null values

2.Using `COUNT` & `DISTINCT` to look for duplicate values in the ID column
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*)-COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) as' NÂ° of Duplicate values'
FROM HC
```
This will be the result: no duplicates ID values

- Let's do some calculation

1.Using `AVG`, `ROUND` & `GROUP BY` to calculate average salary by Department
```sql
SELECT
department,
ROUND(AVG(salary),2) as 'Avg salary'
FROM HC
GROUP BY department
```
This will be the result

2.Using `LIKE` to find employees whose last name start with "D" and that work in IT Department
```sql
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name
FROM HC
WHERE last_name LIKE ('D%') AND department='IT'
```

This will be the result

3.Using `BETWEEN` to find the employees hired from 2016 to 2020 who didn't leave the company

```sql
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name
FROM HC
WHERE (start_date BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2020-31-12')
	AND
	attrition='No'
```
This will be the result

4.Using `CASE` to split the population by Seniority, calculated as the difference between today and the start date
```sql
select
  CASE
    WHEN (CURRENT_DATE-start_date) <=3 THEN 'Junior'
    WHEN (CURRENT_DATE-start_date) <=5 THEN 'Intermediate'
    WHEN (CURRENT_DATE-start_date) <=8 THEN 'Senior'
    ELSE 'Expert'
  END AS Seniority,
COUNT(*) as HC
FROM HC
GROUP BY Seniority
```
This will be the result
